            education on par with international standards. It persistently seeks and adopts innovative methods to
            improve the quality of higher education on a consistent basis.The campus has a cosmopolitan atmosphere
            with students from all corners of the globe. Experienced and learned teachers are strongly encouraged
            to nurture the students. The global standards set at VIT in the field of teaching and research spur us
            on in our relentless pursuit of excellence. In fact, it has become a way of life for us. The highly
            motivated youngsters on the campus are a constant source of pride. Our Memoranda of Understanding with
            various international universities are our major strength. They provide for an exchange of students and
            faculty and encourage joint research projects for the mutual benefit of these universities.
            Many of our students, who pursue their research projects in foreign universities, bring high quality to
            their work and esteem to India and have done us proud. With steady steps, we continue our march forward.
            We look forward to meeting you here at VIT.
